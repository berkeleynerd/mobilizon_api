The following rules must always be followed.

We will only create and run live integration tests in this application via the run_headless_tests.sh script which defines valid live server connection information for both regular and admin accounts.

All communication with the Mobilizon instance must go through the mobilizon_api package methods.

Direct HTTP requests, raw GraphQL queries, or any other communication methods outside the mobilizon_api package are strictly prohibited.
